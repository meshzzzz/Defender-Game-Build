# Defender Game

## Background
You are defending your tower against the evil wizard, who has to come to attack the last stronghold in the land, of which you must defend. You must stop the wizard and his minions by sending out your own apprentices to defeat the evil wizards minions in combat and defend your stronghold and defeat him for good.

## How to play
You load in a game where small red balls, which are the wizards minions, "attack" your tower by heading torwards it, if they succeed you will lose 10% of your magic skill points, which are presented as health. To prevent this you can summon an apprentice and give them a skill, and they will attack the nearest minion, if they successfully defeat a minion, the stronghold will regain 10% of its skill points. You continue doing this until the evil wizard is defeated (which is currently not possible), or your stronghold gets overwhelmed by minions, and runs out of skillpoints.
