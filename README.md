# Defender Game

## Background
You are defending the stronghold against the evil wizard, who has to come to attack the last stronghold in the land. You must stop the wizard and his minions by sending out your own apprentices to defeat the evil wizard’s minions in combat and defend your stronghold.

## How to play
*	Use the bottom right UI buttons to place an apprentice of the according type
*	5 apprentices can be present at a time
*	Click a spawned apprentice to open the skill tree and assign a skill
*	Enemies from several spawnpoints will move towards your stronghold – if they reach the stronghold, you will lose 10% of your skill points (represented currently as a hp bar)
*	You can summon an apprentice without giving them a skill, in which case they will stay in an idle state until you select them to assign a skill (to be changed to auto assignment on spawn)
*	You continue until the evil wizard is defeated (which is currently not possible), or your stronghold gets overwhelmed by minions, and hp is depleted
